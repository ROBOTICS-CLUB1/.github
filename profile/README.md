## Who We Are

We are a community of curious and driven students passionate about **robotics, engineering, and innovation**, based at **Rwanda Coding Academy**.  
Our mission is simple: **learn by building**, iterate fast, and turn ideas into functional, real-world systems.

From microcontrollers to autonomous systems, we explore how software and hardware work together to solve practical problems.

---

## What We Do

- Design and build robotic systems
- Learn embedded systems and low-level programming
- Collaborate on hands-on engineering projects
- Explore automation, electronics, and control systems

We combine curiosity with discipline to create projects that are both educational and impactful.
